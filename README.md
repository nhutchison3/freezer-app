# Freezer App

Tired of forgetting what's buried in the Benthic zone of your freezer?

Find yourself buying duplicates of items and feeling guilt over tossing out the sourdough you should've used for breadcrumbs?

Run this project as a set of containers, access it on your local network, and add your items so you can keep track without having to dig through your tiny Arctic box.

<i>really, this was just an excuse to play with nestjs</i>

## Goals

- Cleaner docker-compose
- Fix frontend container build
- Figure out an easy ngrok setup (or buy a domain name, someday)
- Clean up typeorm queries
- Add DTOs between the API models and orm entities
